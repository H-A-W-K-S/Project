###MergeSplit Tile Game

We have decided to create MergeSplit, which will be a point based game that posts a user's highest score if that score is higher than the all-time record. The game will be played on an 8x8 board of tiles. The objective of MergeSplit will be to merge all tiles into one large tile.

The game will be mobile-oriented and use a web service to store the highest score. Users will download the game and play it client-side. Once they finish the game, the app will tell them how close their score is to the all-time record. If they earn a score that is higher than the current all-time record, the app will automatically upload the score to the web server.

Players can merge 4 tiles to make 1 tile that is the size of four combined tiles. The tile color will vary. To merge, Â¾ of the tiles must be the same color, and all tiles must be the same size. You can strategically merge and split tiles to make them of the same color. The game design will be somewhat similar to other tile-based games such as Candy Crush, Tic-Tac-Toe, or Carcassonne.

The game will be 2D, as that is easy and enjoyable to play. The game will be simplistic with minimal tutorial or instructions. Colors and sounds will be the primary sensory inputs. Additionally, the dopamine feedback cycles should be short because the player performs an action and gets a reward in the span of a few seconds, and repeats. On the contrary, strategic games that require long-term critical thinking are also a very enjoyable form of game.

People will find this game fun because it creates the perfect combination of strategic and impulsive thinking. The game will incorporate challenging problem-solving and satisfying rewards for solving these problems.

The target demographic for this app will be people who enjoy solving puzzles, but the app is also very accessible to the common person. We will try to minimize words and make the game as intuitive as possible. The name of the game (MergeSplit) is even self-explanatory.

This game is unique. Most games lean either towards strategy or impulse-driven gameplay. This game finds the balance between both.
