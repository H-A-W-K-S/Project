MergeSplit Tutorial 

Welcome to MergeSplit! This is an exciting color based tile merging game. Upon opening the game, you will be presented with a game board containing an 8 by 8 grid of differently colored tiles. Your job will be to click on small clusters of tiles with matching colors until they merge into bigger tiles of the same color. If you click again on the newly merged tile, it will break apart into four smaller tiles of the original size. Use merging and splitting strategically until you have converted the game board into a grid of 64 similarly colored tiles. Once you complete this task, you have won the game!

How to Navigate the App:

As you have seen, opening this app takes you to a welcome page with six buttons. The big button on the left will open the game board and the buttons on the right will take you to the leaderboard, about page, and settings page. You are on the tutorial page. Click the back button at the top of this page to go back to the welcome page.

Settings:

There are four settings to adjust based on your playing preferences. The first is the audio setting. If you check the box marked “sound”, a sliding blue bubble will appear or recede within a small receptacle, toggling the game’s musical sounds on and off. The second setting is known as dark mode, and checking this box will toggle the background color between white and dark blue. Haptic feedback is another box you can select if you want the screen to vibrate whenever you make an invalid move. Finally, there is a setting known as Haim Goblin Mode which triggers a timer and reshuffles the colors when your time expires.

The Leader Board:

MergeSplit is a multi-player game and we hope that you enjoy it! In order to make the experience more pleasurable for you, we have implemented a leader board that keeps track of the five highest scores. Keep reading to find out how your score is evaluated. 



How to Play:

Upon opening the game, you will see 64 differently colored tiles arranged in a grid. Scan for 2 by 2 clusters of tiles in the game board where three or more of the tiles are the same color. Once you find a suitable square made up of four tiles, click the center of the square where the four corners join together. This will trigger the four tiles in the square to combine into one big square of the same color. 

The following diagram shows how this works. It is worth mentioning that if only one or two of the components making up the tile are of a matching color, clicking on the square won’t trigger a merge event. Furthermore, be aware that you can also click a merged square and break it up into its component squares.This break will often spawn new merge possibilities, so it is often advantageous to split tiles after they have been merged.  



How your Score is Evaluated:

Every player is given a score of 100 at the beginning of every game. For every merge or split you perform, 1 point will be deducted from your score. Additionally, a timer will start when you first open the game and your time will be displayed. If you have Goblin Mode selected, the same scoring will apply even after the board is reset. Thank you for reading our tutorial and we hope you come back to play again soon!

Cheers,
The MergeSplit Development Team.
