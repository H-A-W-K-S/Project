VISION STATEMENT

For our software engineering team project application, we decided to create an app that hosts a game which allows anyone to post their highest score. The game would be mobile-oriented and use a web service to store the highest score. Users would download the game and play it client-side. Once they earn a score that is higher than the current record, the app would automatically upload the score to the web server.
As for the game itself, the game will be 2D, as that is the easiest to implement in javascript. The game should be incredibly simplistic; no tutorial or instructions should be needed. Gameplay will come naturally and instinctively. Colors and sounds will be the primary sensory inputs. Additionally, the dopamine feedback cycles should be short. The player performs an action and gets a reward in the span of a few seconds, and repeats.
Specifically, the game will be tile-based. You will start with a 32x32 (or 16x16?) grid of tiles, and your objective is to merge them all into a single tile. You can merge 4 tiles to make 1 tile of the next tier. The tiles will be of differing colors. To merge, Â¾ of the tiles must be the same color, and all must be the same size. You can strategically merge and split tiles to make them of the same color.
