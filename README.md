People love simple competitive games that provide quick rewards. Consequently, we have decided to create an app with a game that posts a user's highest score if that score is higher than the all-time record. The game will be mobile-oriented and use a web service to store the highest score. Users would download the game and play it client-side. Once they finish the game, the app would tell them how close their score is to the all-time record. If the player earns a score that is higher than the current all-time record, the app would automatically upload the score to the web server.
As for the game itself, the game will be 2D, as that is easy and enjoyable to play. The game will be simplistic with minimal tutorial or instructions. Colors and sounds will be the primary sensory inputs. Additionally, the dopamine feedback cycles should be short because the player performs an action and gets a reward in the span of a few seconds, and repeats.
The game design will be tile-based. Players will start with an 8x8 grid of tiles, and the player's objective is to merge them all into a single tile. Players can merge 4 tiles to make 1 tile that is the size of four combined tiles. The tile color will vary. To merge, Â¾ of the tiles must be the same color, and all tiles must be the same size. You can strategically merge and split tiles to make them of the same color.
